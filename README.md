# One-Dimensional-Optimization---Unrestricted-Method
In most practical problems, the optimum solution is known to lie within restricted ranges of the design variables. In some cases this range is not known, and hence the search has to be made with no restrictions on the values of the variables. Although the search with a ﬁxed step size appears to be very simple, its major limitation comes because of the unrestricted nature of the region in which the minimum can lie. The code written is for the following question :  Find the minimum of f = x(x −1.5) by starting from 0.0 with an initial step size of 0.05
